# Fabric Minecraft Server for Improved Performance
A quick way of setting up an optimised Minecraft Java Edition server. 
## What makes it better?
Compared to [Paper](https://papermc.io/) It makes chunk generation a lot faster and it supports Fabric mods.

> This project uses the [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net) and [Ferium](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium) to automatically download the server files.

> Platforms supported: `Windows`.

## Windows Guide

1. Download the **zip** and extract it inside a folder.

2. Run the `install.bat` to install the mod files. 
3. Run `start.bat` to run the server. 

- The first time you run the `start.bat` it will take longer because it will download all the server files.
- Anytime you want to start the server just run `start.bat`
## TODO
- [ ] Make changes to mob behaiviour, might improve performance.
- [ ] Make better documentation.
- [ ] Make the batch script better.
