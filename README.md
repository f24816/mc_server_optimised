# Fabric Minecraft Server with Improved Performance
A quick way of setting up an optimised Minecraft Java Edition server. 

I would recomend [Pufferfish](https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish) for a server with plugins with even better performance. 

> This project uses the [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net) and [Ferium](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium) to automatically download the server files.

> Platforms supported: `Windows`.

## Windows Guide

1. Download the **zip** and extract it inside a folder.

2. Run the `install.bat` to install the mod files. 
3. Run `start.bat` to run the server. 
4. Pregenerate world `/chunky spawn` then `/chunky radius 1600` and `/chunky start`.
