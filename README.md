# Minecraft Server for Improved Performance
This is a quick way of setting up an optimised Minecraft Java Edition server.
> Platforms it works on `windows`.

> This project uses the [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net) and [Ferium](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium) to automatically download the server files.
## Windows Guide

1. Download the **zip** and extract it inside a folder.

2. Run the `install.bat` to install the mod files. 
3. Run `start.bat` to run the server. 

- The first time you run the `start.bat` it will take longer because it will download all the server files.
- Anytime you want to start the server just run `start.bat`
